# hello-world
Just getting started, nothing to see here
I have been interested in web-development for a few years, running my Wordpress sites and all that
After deciding to use an old MacbookAir to play with Ubuntu Server I decided to go a bit further
So in my spare time I am learning how to code...just like a billion other people out here
